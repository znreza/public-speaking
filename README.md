1. [Privacy Preserving AI - Perform Data Science on data you cannot see](https://github.com/znreza/public-speaking/blob/main/Women-Who-Code-PPAI.pdf)

  This talk was given Women Who Code CONNECT REIMAGINE global conference particpated by thousands of developers, engineers, speakers and recruiters. In this presenation I talked about the following,
  
   a. Why should we care about data privacy?
   
   b. Privacy Preserving AI tools
     i. Federated Learning
     ii. Differential Privacy
     iii. Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC)
    
   c. Real use-case of an end-to-end encrypted machine learning pipeline on medical data
   
   d. How to get started with Privacy Preserving AI field
   
   #### Summary: 
   Data is the new electricity. Although data is everywhere, it is not always easy to access for privacy reasons. In this talk I will discuss about how AI models can be trained on data we don't have access to. Privacy-preserving AI is still quite new, but soon it will become inevitable. If you are a data scientist or ML engineer, this skill will put you one step ahead from your peers.
